# OpenGL

I have submitted 1 python file, can be run normally. It is a simulation of a car moving with the color switch of a traffic light.

# Blender

I have submitted 2 blender files 
- Final_1.blend consists of the football goal scoring simulation I made on my own without the help of online resources.

- Final_2.blend consists of a lowpoly render, without the addition of the ball animation. For this file, I used online resources as mentioned in the project report.

- Image attachments - I have shown 1 .png file each for the 2 blender files I have submitted, each showing how the final render looks.

- Video attachment - Since I could not render the animation of the Final_1 file, I rendered the animation of the Final_2 file as a video and have attached it as Blender_2_video.mkv.

I have attached the **report** of my procedure and thinking for both the projects in the zip file as well, labeled as Project_Report_Suyash.pdf.
